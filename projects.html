    <span><a href="https://trinket.io/html/e1a97fd9e5" target="_blank"> Click Here! This project is a presentation on myself.It's very simple to talk about you but 
       to create a website about yourself? That's the difficult part. Just making sure that all your coding and spacing is right is nerve-wrecking, 
      Your always checking every little thing, if you spelled something right,or had the comma in just the right place.This project was one of the first I completed fully. It tells the
      story of a girl with a dream of becoming an actress.Just click this paragraph to see my Tell A Story remix.</a></span>
      
      <span><a href="https://trinket.io/html/14282670ae" target="_blank"> Click Here! This project was when we first starting learning how to structure our websites. I chose to do one of my favorite dishes that my mom cooked for me once. I didn't face any particular difficulties while creating this. Although I didn't get to finish it.</a></span>

         I honestly did't really know what I was doing when I created this project. Ms.Corrales gave us the basic code for it but we had to customize it ourselves. I was just tinkering around and it ended up being a really nice project. Oh yeah and Chewy, that's what I named my turtle.</a></span>
